# Course Navigation and Lab Resources Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to access and use the 70+ hands-on labs provided in the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate 003 course. Each lab includes multiple resource formats to accommodate different learning preferences and workflows.

---

## Accessing Lab Resources

### Resources Button Location

- Located on the side of the screen for each lab lesson
- Provides access to three primary resource types

### Available Resource Types

#### 1. PDF Lab Guides

- **Format**: Downloadable PDF documents
- **Purpose**: Offline reference and step-by-step instructions
- **Indicator**: Download icon displayed next to the resource
- **Usage**: Download and reference while following video instruction

#### 2. GitHub Repository Links

- **Format**: Markdown files hosted on GitHub
- **Organization**:
  - Structured by course section
  - Numbered sequentially within each section for easy navigation
- **Advantages**:
  - Properly formatted for screen viewing
  - Easy code copying without formatting issues
  - Direct paste into code editors (VS Code, etc.)
- **Recommended**: Primary method for copying Terraform code

#### 3. Official Documentation Links

- **Purpose**: Deep-dive learning on specific topics
- **Content**: Links to HashiCorp official documentation relevant to the lab topic

---

## Lab Pre-Requisite Code

### Purpose

Lab Pre-Req links provide starter code for students who:

- Skip sections and jump to specific topics
- Want to work on modules or advanced topics without completing prior labs
- Need to catch up after interruptions

### Location

- Found under the Resources section of relevant lessons
- Available at the beginning of major course sections (e.g., Modules section)

### When to Use

- **Use**: When jumping to a different section out of sequence
- **Skip**: When following the course top-down as designed

---

## Terraform Workflow

### Recommended Lab Approach

1. Open the lesson video
2. Click the Resources button
3. Access the GitHub markdown link
4. Copy code directly into your local editor
5. Follow along with video instruction
6. Reference PDF for offline review if needed

## Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Code Version Discrepancies

- **Issue**: Video recordings may show slightly different code than provided resources
- **Reason**: AWS frequently updates services and APIs
- **Solution**: Use the code from GitHub/Resources links, which is updated regularly
- **Note**: Videos cannot be re-recorded for every AWS change

### Course Focus

- **Primary Goal**: Learn Terraform concepts and workflow
- **Secondary**: AWS provider-specific implementation
- **Implication**: Minor AWS syntax differences do not affect core Terraform learning objectives

### PDF Limitations

- **Challenge**: Code copying from PDFs can introduce formatting errors
- **Resolution**: GitHub markdown files were added based on student feedback
- **Best Practice**: Always use GitHub links for code copying

---

## Common Exam Traps

### Sequential Learning

- **Trap**: Skipping foundational sections to jump to advanced topics
- **Risk**: Missing prerequisite knowledge required for exam domains
- **Recommendation**: Follow course sequentially unless using Lab Pre-Req code

### Provider vs. Terraform Core

- **Trap**: Confusing AWS-specific syntax with Terraform core concepts
- **Exam Focus**: Terraform Associate 003 tests Terraform fundamentals, not cloud provider specifics
- **Study Tip**: Understand the distinction between HCL syntax and provider resource arguments

## Key Terms & Definitions

| Term                 | Definition                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lab Pre-Req**      | Starter code that sets up the environment state needed to begin a specific lab without completing prior sections |
| **Resources Button** | UI element in course platform providing access to PDFs, GitHub links, and documentation                          |
| **Markdown Format**  | Text formatting syntax used for GitHub lab files; renders cleanly in browsers and editors                        |
| **Section**          | Major course division organizing related labs (e.g., "Modules," "State Management")                              |

### Updated Information (as of 2025)

- **GitHub Markdown Addition**: GitHub links were added after initial course launch based on student feedback regarding PDF code-copying difficulties. This is now the recommended method for accessing lab code.
- **AWS Provider Updates**: Code in GitHub resources is maintained separately from video recordings to reflect current AWS provider syntax. Always prioritize written code over video examples when discrepancies occur.
