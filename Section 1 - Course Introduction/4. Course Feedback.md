## Concepts

- **Learning Community Engagement:** Students are encouraged to actively support one another by sharing course experiences and feedback.

- **Peer Guidance:** Reviews assist future learners in assessing whether the course aligns with their goals.
- **Instructor Transparency:** The instructor highlights an iterative approach to course quality, adapting content based on student responses.

## Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Do not skip course feedback:** It directly improves future Terraform Associate content.
- **Be concise yet constructive:** Specific notes on what was clear or confusing are more valuable than general praise.
- **Engage early:** Submitting reviews during or soon after completion ensures accuracy and relevance.
