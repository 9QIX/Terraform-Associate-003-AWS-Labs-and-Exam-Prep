# What is Infrastructure as Code

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a methodology that enables managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. It serves as a collaboration hub across organizations to improve infrastructure deployments, increase scaling capabilities, and enhance application development processes.

## Concepts

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files
- **Codification**: Converting manual infrastructure tasks into code-based configurations
- **Version Control**: Managing infrastructure changes through standard software development practices
- **Live Documentation**: Code serves as active documentation of infrastructure configuration

## Benefits of Infrastructure as Code

### Automation and Standardization

- **Manual Process Elimination**: Replaces manual configuration across multiple platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, VMware)
- **Consistent Deployments**: Standardizes infrastructure provisioning across environments
- **Reduced Human Error**: Minimizes configuration drift and manual mistakes

### Scalability and Self-Service

- **Capacity on Demand**: Provides infrastructure scaling for applications and internal teams
- **Developer Empowerment**: Enables developers to provision approved infrastructure without operations team intervention
- **Module-Based Approach**: Allows consumption of pre-approved, standardized infrastructure components

### Collaboration and Governance

- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Bridges operations, security, and development teams
- **Approval Workflows**: Ensures infrastructure meets organizational standards before deployment
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains history of infrastructure changes through version control

## Infrastructure as Code Tools Comparison

| Tool                                | Cloud Support                  | Primary Use Case                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **HashiCorp Terraform**             | Multi-cloud, Platform-agnostic | Cross-platform infrastructure management         |
| **AWS CloudFormation**              | AWS-specific                   | Native AWS resource management                   |
| **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**    | Azure-specific                 | Native Azure resource management                 |
| **Google Cloud Deployment Manager** | GCP-specific                   | Native Google Cloud resource management          |
| **Pulumi**                          | Multi-cloud, Platform-agnostic | Cross-platform with programming language support |

### Multi-Cloud vs. Cloud-Specific Tools

**Multi-Cloud Tools (Terraform, Pulumi):**

- Deploy across multiple cloud providers in single configuration
- Platform-agnostic approach
- Consistent syntax across different providers

**Cloud-Specific Tools (CloudFormation, ARM, Deployment Manager):**

- Deep integration with native cloud services
- Provider-specific features and optimizations
- Tighter coupling with cloud platform capabilities

## Terraform Workflow

### Multi-Platform Deployment

Terraform enables deployment across multiple platforms within a single configuration:

- **AWS**: Application servers and compute resources
- **Azure**: Database services and storage
- **On-Premises**: Load balancers and networking components
- **SaaS/PaaS**: Third-party service configurations

## Configuration Management vs. Infrastructure as Code

### Key Distinctions

**Infrastructure as Code Tools:**

- Provision and manage infrastructure resources
- Create the foundation (servers, networks, storage)
- Examples: Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM

**Configuration Management Tools:**

- Configure and manage existing infrastructure
- Operate on already-provisioned resources
- Examples: Puppet, Chef, SaltStack, Ansible

### Workflow Integration

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use IaC tools to create resources
2. **Configuration Management**: Use CM tools to configure provisioned resources
3. **Application Deployment**: Deploy applications on configured infrastructure

## Key Terms & Definitions

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Practice of managing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files
- **Multi-Cloud**: Strategy using multiple cloud service providers
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Tools that work across different platforms and providers
- **Module**: Reusable infrastructure configuration component
- **Configuration Drift**: Unplanned changes to infrastructure configuration over time

## Common Exam Traps

- **Tool Classification**: Understanding difference between IaC and configuration management tools
- **Platform Scope**: Knowing which tools are cloud-specific vs. multi-cloud
- **Workflow Order**: Infrastructure provisioning must occur before configuration management
- **Use Case Selection**: Choosing appropriate tools based on organizational requirements
